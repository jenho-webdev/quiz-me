# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## About the App

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, youâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment and perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help familiarize you with these tests and questions, the app allows you to take a timed multiple-choice quize on JavaScript fundementals. The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. In the feature release of the app, we planned to add interative coding qustions and updated pool of questions. See roadmap section of this document for more planned features in the coming releases. 

## User Story


    AS A coding boot camp student
    I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
    SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over
    WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and my scorce

## Roadmap

- Allow user to select the total number of questions that they will be quiz on in an incremental of 10.
- Instead of using time remaining and -5sec for wrong answer as a scoring system. Develop a more robust scoring system that will scale with different number of questions set.
- Support interactive coding questions
- Include HTML and CSS questions
- support emailing result to user.
